You climb into the refrigerator and slowly start climbing down the long staircase. With each step you grow more nervous. "Why are there stairs in the refrigerator?" you think to yourself. The whole situation you find yourself in odd and terrifying.
When you finally reach the bottom of the stairs you see a white plate with something on it. It comes into view as you get closer. Sitting on the plate is a slice of your favorite cake with a fork sticking out. You eat the cake and your mind goes blank, and you head back up the stairs to the kitchen where you black out on the floor.
