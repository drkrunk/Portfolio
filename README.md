Thanks for your interests in my portfolio. My name it Nathen Padilla and I graduated with as asscoiates dregee in programming. I have created this section to demonstrate that I have a solid understanding of programming.

# Portfolio
A collection of example projects that demonstrate various programming ideas. While all/most these examples are in C#, I'm confidant that I could accomplish the same goals in any other language. C# just happens to be my progamming language of choice. I have taliored these projects to be the simplest form of their respected subjects.
