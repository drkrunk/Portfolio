Slugr was a web app that allowed you to create and track issues. I wanted to test my abilities to create a fullstack application. I used java, spring boot, and mssql for the backend.  For the frontend I used typescript, angular and sass.

It's features included:
- Create Projects
- Add people to projects
- Add tickets to projects
- Comment on tickets


These [Modles](https://pages.github.com/](https://github.com/drkrunk/Portfolio/tree/master/Web/SlugrProject/SlugrServer/issuetracker/model)) are a good representation of the database.
