Slugr was a web app that allowed you to create and track issues. I wanted to test my abilities to create a fullstack application. I used java, spring boot, and mssql for the backend.  For the frontend I used typescript, angular and sass.

It's features included:
-Create Projects
-Add people to projects
-Add tickets to projects
-Comment on tickets
