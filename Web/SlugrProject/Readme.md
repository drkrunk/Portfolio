# Slugr

Slugr was a web app that allowed you to create and track issues for projects. I wanted to test my abilities to create a fullstack application as well as practice UX/UI design. I used java, spring boot, and mssql for the backend. For the frontend I used typescript, angular and sass. The project took the better half of a month while learning Angular and Spring boot as well authentication/authorization and other concepts.

It's features included:
- Authentication
- Authorization
- CRUD user profiles
- CRUD public and private Projects
- CRUD tickets for projects
- Add/Delete people to projects
- Add/Delete tickets to projects
- Share projects
- Comment on tickets
- Pin tickets
- Tag tickets
- Sort tickets by tags

These [Models](https://pages.github.com/](https://github.com/drkrunk/Portfolio/tree/master/Web/SlugrProject/SlugrServer/issuetracker/model)) are a good representation of the database created for the project.

These [Contorllers](https://github.com/drkrunk/Portfolio/tree/master/Web/SlugrProject/SlugrServer/issuetracker/controllers) demonstrates what can be done with backend api.
