# Notes
What are components? 
In react a component represents a part of the user interface.


Components Properties
- They describe part of the UI.
- They should be reuseable.
- Components can contain other components such as the App(root) component nesting every other component.

There are 2 types of components in React stateless functional and stateful class component.

Stateless components - They are usually just a simple function that returns html code that describes the UI.
Stateful components - They extend from the component class and must define a render method that returns html code that describes the UI.
